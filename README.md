### Hi There 👋

🔭 I'm working on building a massive website 🕸️ that is widely accepted by everyone. Maybe I won't address this point until I've completed the task I set out to do...

🌱 I'm currently learning MERN stack also Web-Dev which is completely new to me but that is how learning works we learn new things everyday.

👯 Collaboration never thought of it hopefully in the future when I gain enough knowledge to collaborate with other people.

🤔 I'm looking for help with learning Javascript and C Programing.

💬 You can ask me about anything related to my previous work exprience and College.

⚡ Fun fact: 💻 Windows 1.0 version had a 16-bit interface, which was less than 1MB. It needs a minimum of 256 KB, a graphics adapter card, and two-sided floppy disk drives 💾.

⚡ Another fact: The average internet 🛜 user takes only 0.05 seconds (50 milliseconds) ⏱️ to form an opinion about your website 😲. That’s less time than it takes to blink an eye! 👀
